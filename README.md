As the writers of this journal project, I contributed significantly to the data analysis and visualization processes using Microsoft Power BI. My responsibilities included designing and implementing the dashboard to analyze UTBK 2019 data, focusing on the distribution of scores, academic preferences, and university capacities. I also played a key role in data preprocessing and ensuring the accuracy of visualizations to derive actionable insights. Additionally, I collaborated on formulating research questions, interpreting the findings, and crafting recommendations to support decision-making in Indonesia's education sector. This project reflects my expertise in data analytics and my ability to translate complex datasets into meaningful insights for academic and institutional improvements."
